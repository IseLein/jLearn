An elementary project for school records management

Developed by the intermediate class of the #XploreSTEMi coding camp '21 as the final project.
Written in Java.

A simple school record management system that organizes the scores of 10 students taking 5 subjects.
It is organized by a single admin(teacher).
The individual scores are entered into an interactive table and the total scores, grades and remarks are automatically calculated by the system and stored.
The storage occurs in files on the hard disk(They are not tempfiles, the filepath is determined by the admin.)
A comprehensive result is generated upon request for each student and stored in a file whose path is also determined by the user.
The results can then be printed into .txt files and can be accessed later on.

This is a small scale prototype. It could be developed to large management systems for schools and even marketing organisations. A major improvement on this would be to use an effective database system (as opposed to the file system used in this one).
